# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/rghdgfibq3fe9vvtuyveap)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file in the project root and add your Paystack key:

   ```bash
   VITE_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_your_key_here
   ```

   > Vite only exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_`, so be sure to include that prefix.

3. Run `npm run dev`
