# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/rghdgfibq3fe9vvtuyveap)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file in the project root and add your Pesapal credentials:

   ```bash
   # Frontend (if needed)
   VITE_PESAPAL_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key_here
   
   # Backend (server/.env)
   PESAPAL_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key_here
   PESAPAL_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
   PESAPAL_SANDBOX=true  # Set to false for production
   ```

   > Vite only exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_`, so be sure to include that prefix.

3. (Optional) Configure extra settings such as trash retention for deleted pages:

   ```bash
   CONTENT_TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS=30
   ```

4. Run `npm run dev`
